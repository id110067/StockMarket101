> Investing in stocks is a very important financial strategy in todayâ€™s
> world, as it enables one to grow with the economy, also to make money
> in two ways. Starting early is the key to becoming a successful
> investor. For example, educating students about investment is very
> important, and presently, in schools, the only focus is to teach
> formulas of compounding, hence they end up in between some numeric
> values, the significance of which they may not understand.
>
> Through virtual world simulation, we want to give our players the
> experience required, also help them understand what compounding and
> investing actually means. Our game can be a wonderful platform for
> potential investors to build their own portfolio and gain the
> experience and feel of placing trade and orders.
