> Investing in stocks is a very important financial strategy in today’s
> world, as it enables one to grow with the economy, also to make money
> in two ways. Starting early is the key to becoming a successful
> investor. For example, educating students about investment is very
> important, and presently, in schools, the only focus is to teach
> formulas of compounding, hence they end up in between some numeric
> values, the significance of which they may not understand.
>
> Through virtual world simulation, we want to give our players the
> experience required, also help them understand what compounding and
> investing actually means. Our game can be a wonderful platform for
> potential investors to build their own portfolio and gain the
> experience and feel of placing trade and orders.

>**Features incorporating coding requirements:**

1.  *Generation of random game sets or events:*

> The current market value of stocks would be made dynamic.

2.  *Data structures for storing game status:*

> We will be using arrays, struct and classes for storing our game data.

3.  *Dynamic memory management:*

> Used for storing details of past transactions, including profit/loss
> made, historical prices of stocks.

4.  *File input/output* (e.g., for loading/saving game status):

> We will be using two binary files for storing game data, one for user
> details, and another for details of stocks

5.  *Program codes in multiple files*:

> We will be using many functions in our code, creating a different .cpp
> file to store function definitions, function prototypes, and the main
> function.
